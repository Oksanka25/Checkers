## Stretch Goals

- Have move tips for players - the tiles where they can possibly move.
- Add a 'King Me' option:
When a piece reaches a space in the row on the opposite side of the board (the “King Me” row), its player picks up the piece and crowns it by twisting its base counter-clockwise, then sets it back on its space.  It is now a King!  Kings are move powerful than pieces because they can move diagonally forward and backwards. Kings may combine jumps in several directions–forward and backward–on the same turn. 
- Add a jumping move option: 
A piece makes a jump by diagonally leaping over one of the opponent’s pieces and landing on the empty space on the other side (there must be an empty space to land on).  Multiple jumps are allowed on a single turn. When a piece is jumped (“captured”), it is removed from the board and is now out of play.
